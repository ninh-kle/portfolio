                    <p>This is a biographical page. For this project I thought I would do a
                        fictional character to make it bit more fun. I chose Son Goku from the long running hit anime
                        series: Dragonball. If you look at my biographical page, you'll see an homage to a long running
                        joke in the series. As for the functionality of this page it is pretty basic HTML and very
                        limited CSS. This was my introductary project as you may have guessed.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p>This is a survey form. The topic of they survey was left open-ended. For this project I
                        chose somewhat of a dark humor approach. When I previously created this survey form we were
                        in the midst of a very heated presidential election in the middle of a global pandemic. I was
                        trying to capture the emotions felt by millions of American citizens. As for the functionality
                        of this page it incorperated the use of simple radio buttons, a selection menu, check list,
                        even a text area for additional information, and a submit button.</p>

                    <p>This is a product landing page. The original project called for a landing page for a product of
                        my choosing. I had a difficult time selecting a specific product to market. Instead I chose to
                        do an online ordering system for my favorite food in the world: hot dogs. It's always been my
                        dream that if I were able to retire do anything else I would open up my own hot dog stand. As
                        for the functionality of this page it features a navigation bar, embedded video, data input
                        fields, and responsive
                        design using BootStrap. It also includes some of the previous things I learned such as: check
                        lists, selection
                        menues, and a submit button.</p>
